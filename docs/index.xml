      <description>Hello World.
First let me start off by saying how exciting this is. Yeah yeah..every one these days has a blog so you might ask what&amp;rsquo;s so special about this one. The answer is&amp;hellip;Nothing.
I&amp;rsquo;m technically doing this for my own personal satisfaction.
I have a few motives that are driving me to regularly contribute to this blog.
Firstly, I have a goal to contribute to more open source software. I&amp;rsquo;m primarily a Golang developer now, but I have done some Java and Javascript in the past.</description>

      <description>whoami I am a husband to a loving wife.
I am the master overlord to my pitty-puppy.
I am a software engineer who yearns to contribute to a greater goal.
I am a citizen to a world that desperately needs help.
whyami I see myself as an engineer who wishes to contribute to projects that better this world.
Sounds corny&amp;hellip;yeah I agree, but don&amp;rsquo;t think I could have put it any any other way.</description>
