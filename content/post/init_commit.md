Hello World.

First let me start off by saying how exciting this is. Yeah yeah..every one
these days has a blog so you might ask what's so special about this one. The
answer is...Nothing.

I'm technically doing this for my own personal satisfaction. I do have a few
reasons like

  - improving my typing on my cool new keyboard
  - learning more about Hugo so I can contribute to it
  - writing my own product reviews
  - discussing about the values of life and what motivates us to get out of bed
and actually contribute to society.

Maybe this will turn out to be something more and actually helps whoever
stumbles upon this blog

If you'd like to know a little about me check out the [About](/about) page.
