Hello World.

First let me start off by saying how exciting this is. Yeah yeah..every one
these days has a blog so you might ask what's so special about this one. The
answer is...Nothing.

I'm technically doing this for my own personal satisfaction.

I have a few motives that are driving me to regularly contribute to this blog.

Firstly, I have a goal to contribute to more open source software. I'm
primarily a Golang developer now, but I have done some Java and Javascript in
the past. I've decided to stick and currently invest in Golang. I looked around
for some interesting Golang projects and found [Hugo](http://gohugo.io). In
order to contribute to something, it makes sense to actually use it. So...I
decided to start this blog which is built using Hugo so I can get to know the
project better.

I've also been interested in sharing my thoughts on certain products and doing
simple reviews for them myself. For example, I've happen to come across a couple
of mechanical keyboards that I'd like to review and compare for those looking
for them. I'm also very interested in the IoT space and I thought I could share
my thoughts on certain IoT devices/services out there.

Finally, I'd like to share some of my values in life, values that motivate me
to get out of bed and actually make a difference. I thought that this might be a
good medium to "discuss it" rather than just writing it in a diary.

So it seems that this blog doesn't have much of a purpose...yet. At the very
least writing these blogs will help improve my typing.
