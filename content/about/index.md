## whoami

I am a husband to a loving wife.

I am the master overlord to my pitty-puppy.

I am a software engineer who yearns to contribute to a greater goal.

I am a citizen to a world that desperately needs help.

## whyami

I see myself as an engineer who wishes to contribute to projects that better
this world.

Sounds corny...yeah I agree, but don't think I could have put it any any other
way. I am no Elon Musk or Bill Gates but I believe that everyone can make a
difference.

My goal is not to change the world but to change someone's world.
